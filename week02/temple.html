            <h2>About the Temple</h2>
            <p> The Curitiba Brazil Temple was the fifth temple built in Brazil. The floor plan created for the Curitiba Brazil Temple was adapted and used for the Vancouver British Columbia Temple and Manaus Brazil Temple. The gold-leafed angel Moroni statue was installed atop the spire of the Curitiba Brazil Temple on January 11, 2008. Over 42,000 visitors took the opportunity to tour the Curitiba Brazil Temple during its two-week public open house. President James E. Faust served as a young missionary in Curitiba and later presided over South America as a general authority. President Gordon B. Hinckley planned to take Pres. Faust with him to dedicate the Curitiba Brazil Temple, but both passed away in the months preceding the dedication. President Thomas S. Monson's trip to dedicate the Curitiba Brazil Temple was his first trip outside North America as president of the Church.</p>
