    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>

    <p>I currently live in the city of Pinhais, which is located in the state of Paraná, Brazil. This city is part of the metropolitan region of the capital. The name "Pinhais" comes from Pinus, a traditional tree from Paraná known as the Pine Tree, which is also the symbolic tree of the state.</p>
